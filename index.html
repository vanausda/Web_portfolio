with their placement, things began to flow much easier. I really enjoyed working with the shapes and changing them.</p>

previously learning skills.</p>
<p style="font-size:100%">Reflection: Cybersecurity has always been an interest of mine, and I think this lesson helped me get the basics. The most
challenging thing was making the connection because it only takes one little comma to throw everything out of whack. Loving the class!</p>

and XML.</p>
<p style="font-size:100%">Reflection: Reinforcing previous lessons and learning how to secure my password and database information was a great lesson for me. I've learned a lot 
in this class. I began filling out applications and sending out my resume today, and it was nice to be able to list all the different languages we learned. I know this class will
play a huge roll in my landing a job.</p>
